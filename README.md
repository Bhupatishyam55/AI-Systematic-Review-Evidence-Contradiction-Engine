# AI Systematic Review & Evidence Contradiction Engine

## 💡 Project Overview

The **AI Systematic Review & Evidence Contradiction Engine** is a full-stack application designed to automate the initial stages of a systematic review. By leveraging the **Google Gemini LLM** (via the FastAPI backend), the system extracts key clinical data (PICO-O) from multiple research papers and automatically identifies conflicting evidence, displaying results in high-value, regulatory interpretation-ready visualizations.

This project demonstrates expertise in LLM Prompt Engineering, Asynchronous Processing, Pydantic Data Modeling, and modern React visualization.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend (API)** | **Python (FastAPI)** | Manages file uploads, handles Pydantic data validation, and serves as the proxy for the Gemini LLM. |
| **LLM Engine** | **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Core intelligence for PICO-O extraction, contradiction analysis, and structured numerical data generation. |
| **Frontend (UI)** | **React.js & Tailwind CSS** | User interface for file uploads, state management, and aesthetic styling. |
| **Visualization** | **Recharts** (or similar) | Renders the custom Forest Plot and Conflicting Outcome Map. |
| **Deployment** | **Vercel** (Frontend) & **Render** (Backend) | Live hosting for the entire application. |

## 🌟 Project Workflow: Step-by-Step Output Explanation

This section walks through the process, from file upload to final visualized output, using the application screenshots.

### Step 1: Trial Upload

The user selects multiple clinical trial PDFs to be analyzed in a single batch. The frontend handles concurrent file upload and processing.

### Step 2: Extracted Data & Analysis Summary

The system first presents the overall verdict on the compiled evidence before diving into the details.

#### A. Overall Evidence Strength
The LLM synthesizes the findings to rate the quality and consistency of the combined evidence. Here, the evidence is deemed **Strong** due to consistent, statistically significant results.

#### B. Contradiction & Risk Analysis
The LLM compares the outcomes of the three trials, concluding that the evidence is **consistent** (no contradiction detected), but the Consensus Statement still provides the boilerplate text (an issue resolved by the final prompt fix in the code).

### Step 3: Regulatory Interpretation-Ready Data (PICO-O Consensus Table)

This table is the core regulatory output. It provides the **raw, structured PICO-O elements** extracted directly from the PDFs, including the crucial numerical data (HR, RR, CI) in the Outcome column.

### Step 4: High-Value Visualization Outputs

The final step plots the extracted numbers into visual tools necessary for meta-analysis.

#### A. Conflicting Outcome Map Visualization

This map instantly converts the text-based Outcome data into a color-coded grid, demonstrating the net effect of each intervention.

* **Status:** All three cards are colored **Teal/Green** and labeled **"Benefit"**, visually confirming the LLM's conclusion that all studies are consistent.

#### B. Forest Plot Summary Visualization

The Forest Plot uses the exact **HR/RR** and **95% CI** values extracted from the PDFs to plot the data.

* **Status:** All three points are clustered to the **left** of the red "No Effect (1.0)" line, visually confirming the statistically significant **Benefit** reported by all trials.

## 💾 Raw Data Reference (For Debugging/Validation)

The system retains the exact JSON array generated by the LLM for the Outcome Map, providing a direct reference for validation against the visual output.
